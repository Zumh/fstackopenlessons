Full stack web development involves building both the front-end and back-end components of a web application. In the context of React and HTML, the front-end development is done using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and HTML, the markup language for creating the structure of web pages.

React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be combined to build complex user interfaces. It also provides a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that efficiently updates and renders only the necessary components when the application state changes.

On the back-end, developers can use various technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to handle server-side logic, data storage, and retrieval. This includes handling HTTP requests, managing user authentication and authorization, and interacting with databases.

In summary, full stack web development in React and HTML involves using React to build the front-end user interfaces and HTML for structuring the web pages, while also utilizing back-end technologies and databases to handle server-side logic and data storage.
